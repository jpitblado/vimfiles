# Jeff's Vim setup files

## vimfiles

This is my basic setup for Vim.

## Installation

Run this:

```
git clone https://github.com/jpitblado/vimfiles.git ~/.vim
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```

## Thanks

I use
[Tim Pope's](https://github.com/tpope)
[pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
for managing Vim plugins.

A copy of `pathogen.vim` is included in this repository.
